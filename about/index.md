## Technical Project Manager working at Red Hat:

I am interested in technology research and development, Cloud Computing, Cloud Infrastructure and disruptive technologies and methodologies.
My career is developed on technology services, virtualization, cloud architectures and sometimes even scripting!  
Ups! Almost forgot.. I usually manage customer's expectations and success stories.

* Methodologies:
    * Agile (SCRUM & KANBAN).
    * Waterfall (not my preferred one)
* Cloud Technologies:
    * OpenStack
    * OpenShift
* Infrastructure and automation
* Virtualization & Containers
