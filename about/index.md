## Territory Services Manager working at Red Hat:

I am interested in technology & people, virtualization and cloud projects (SaaS, IaaS and PaaS), development and consultative selling processes. I am a self-organized employee, with high adaptability to continuous changes, with attention to detail. Highly motivated to work in a leading technology company & team-worker.
I have been working on Linux and OpenSource technologies since my graduation. Now I am exploring new challenges: Share my technical knowledge and help others to grow with my current role as a trusted advisor and mentor, helping my company to create innovative solutions for our customers.

Ups! Almost forgot.. I usually manage customer's expectations and success stories.

* Methodologies:
    * Agile (SCRUM & KANBAN).
    * Waterfall (not my preferred one)
* Cloud Technologies:
    * OpenStack (IaaS)
    * OpenShift (PaaS)
    * Google for Work (SaaS)
* Infrastructure and automation
* Virtualization & Containers
